Group Projects and Presentation
CS225
Work in groups of 2 or 3 people.  Each group will choose or be assigned a group topic.  Your project MUST compile and run on prclab and must use C++ unless you receive instructor approval.
C++ Program and Style Guide (80%)
Select a C++ program idea.  Meet with your group and agree on coding style guide for your group.  Discuss program design together and divide the programming tasks equally.  (If you generate any notes/diagrams during design meetings, feel free to submit those when you turn in the project) Your finished project should demonstrate the following concepts we learned in class:
thoughtful selection of variable names, function names, and class names.
division of code into multiple header and source code files
if statements
while, do-while, and/or for loops
functions
class definitions
constructors and destructors
operator overloading
object composition
inheritance
Makefile
exceptions
file I/O
a UML diagram
demonstration of a  C++ command/function/concept that we have not covered in class yet
good programming practices
Type up a style guide that your group has agreed on. (In class we talked about Google’s coding guidelines: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html  Your Style Guide doesn’t have to be nearly this extensive, but when I look at the files produced by different group members, coding styles should match.)
Include a comment section at the top of each file with the name of the Group member that created the Class/Code.  Each group member should be responsible for coding at least 1 file/class but other group members can/should review the code.  
Presentation (20%) 
Create a PowerPoint (or other graphical) presentation that is aimed at your target audience (our class).  
3-5 minutes long.  Presentations will be done in class.  Be able to correctly use C++ vocabulary words from class during your presentation (ex. virtual function, abstract base class, overloading, overriding, scope resolution operator).  
You will be expected to be an attentive listener during all of your classmates’ presentations.
